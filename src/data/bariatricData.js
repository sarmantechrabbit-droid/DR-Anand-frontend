      question: "How does weight reduction occur through obesity surgery?",
      answer: "Weight reduction through obesity surgery is achieved by altering the stomach size or digestive processes. Procedures like gastric bypass make the stomach smaller, limiting food intake, and modifying nutrient absorption. In sleeve gastrectomy, a portion of the stomach is removed, reducing its capacity and affecting appetite-regulating hormones. These changes contribute to substantial weight loss."
